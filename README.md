# Issues

Issues management for the NoCheatPlus project. Does include CompatNoCheatPlus, Docs and NCPTools.

Note the issue template: https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/Issues/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

## Old locations for issues

The old tickets location has been closed down (https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/nocheatplus/tickets/). It would still be possible to reference the old tickets by direct links, in case it should be necessary.

## Labels

Labels are sorted into categories, to allow better sorting and distinction.

(a) 'This is a...', essential grouping by bug, false positive, feature, ...

(c) More abstract affected area, like gameplay, administration, cheat, ...

(c.1) More confined category / check group.

(p) External/future relation (compat, external, future...).

(p.1) Project relation (NCP, cncp, ...).

(q) Quality assurance: attention needed (something missing, need reproduce, ...), short term rather.

(q.1) Importance (less catching the eye).

(r) Resolution (soft): Essential changes have been made, possibly resolved already.

(r.1) Resolution (final): Closed.

The first categories should always be set: (a), (c). (c.1) if it applies, (p) and/or (p.1) if any apply. On closing a ticket, (r) or (r.1) should be set.

## Headline

Prefer staff to alter headlines to match the issue precisely. Add checks or related information not covered by labels in braces.

Examples: 
* "NCP no werk" -> Explosion with stepping on a pressure plate with TNT underneath (Minecraft).
* "Teleport in air = kick" -> Set-back loop with teleport into air (SurvivalFly, PaperSpigot).
